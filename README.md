# Raid Reporter
Raid Reporter is a Destiny 2-themed Discord bot, centered around the !report command, powered by JavaScript, Discord.js, and Discord.js-commando.

The primary function of the command is to collect information on completed activities of a specific character from the Bungie API and format it on request.

I am a novice at JS programming, and much of the code was derived from Adam Gaskins on YouTube. Despite this, it is still not clean whatsoever. The command is not able to grab information without a specified Destiny Membership ID and a character ID 

This bot was made for a specific server, but if you would like to use it in your own, download the report.js file and store it within your bot's files.

Screenshots are available at [my website](bedrock206.net/raid-reporter).

## Dependencies

The command depends on a valid Bungie API Key, a bot environment based on Discord.js, and the node modules discord.js-commando and axios. The bot also requires a Destiny membership ID and charcter ID, as it is static
